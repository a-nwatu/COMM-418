</p> This data was collected using the Google Form, containing 17 submissions, that was sent out before class. The specific question, "Which would you rather confront?:" contained 16 data entries </p>
</p> Overall this was very interesting to track. I felt that using one of the funnier examples from the survey would bring our class closer together, especially since the margins where so close. </p>
</p> Although it's not shown here, I also tried to figure out what perceptage of students used LLM and what they used it for. I had a bit of difficulty figuring out how to get the values of my barchart in correct, ascending order. I want to make sure I can turn a bar graph into percentages with identifiable labels for what the values represent and why. </p>
