<h2> Assignment 2: Workshoping Pitch for Final Project </h2>

<p>
I want to do a trend piece that follows the evolution of slang, based on the Kaggle Dataset listed below, and see how the effects of people's opinions on Hip-hop and Rap with their other interests. 
I think this would be an interesting project because it touches on how Black culture influences popular culture and verbiage in ways that most people won't be able to recognize.
I would love to interview American University students, staff members from WVAU and SDR staff (two organizations that focus on the music industry and college radio culture) to add substance to this pitch.

Right now, the United States is in a culture war and this is apparent through the media that we consume, music and slang being one of them. 
This story would add as a retrospective analysis on where young people have been and where we're going. 
Both data sets are large, contain many entries on demographics and interests, and generally there's a lot to dive into.
Compared to everything going on in the world right now, this would be a cultural-political piece that still has impact on a local scale; American University students, Gen-Z, and yound adults.

These datasets come from a trusted site known for provided vast datasets for many disciplines and fields, Kaggle.
Additionally, they each come with many variables to choose from to make the analysis more interesting. 
I've linked them below in case you want to investigate for yourself :)
