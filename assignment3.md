<h5> Gen-Z Slang Tracking Datasets: Overview and Insights </h5>

<p> Revisiting this dataset has shown a plethora of variables and topics to further report on. For instance, slang has grown as its own language with the help of popular culture, social media, and an increased means of communicating with others digitally. Online behavior and culture is just as important as it is offline; if anything, these behaviors have developed into a sense of social currency. 

GenZ Slang Evolution Tracker, posted by Likitha Gedipui, a post-graduate student at University of Buffalo, New York City, is a fairly large dataset that contains a variety of slang terms from between 2020 to 2025. Gedipui includes a section that lists what makes this particular dataset unique, including factors like platform tracking, engagement metrics, how long the term was used before it faded out of popularity, and term categorization to track how terms are used on the Internet. The Slang Evolution Tracker makes for a handy dictionary to understand this rapidly-changing digital language. 

An interesting to track would be to see the frequency of certain term categorization and what that can tell us about our interactions online. Slang is typically used on social media, and can affect how we perceive ourselves and the community around us. It can also be a way to signal the passage of time and arising trends in other areas of pop-culture. You’ll often hear this idea of the “trend cycle” which tracks the evolution of trends; its start, peak, and eventual end. This passage could also be used to signify which age demographics are “on” or “off” trends—sometimes things pass so fast we don’t even know what’s trending!

Likitha Gedipui’s slang tracking dataset is a great tool for any reporter looking to see how this form of language informs us of our behavioral patterns, how we assign value to things indirectly, and anyone trying to understand how Gen-Z communicates with each other.
